# Electric Vehicles Market Size Analysis using Python

## Overview

Market size analysis is a crucial aspect of market research that determines the potential sales volume within a given market. This project focuses on the market size analysis of electric vehicles (EVs) in the United States. The analysis explores the growth of the EV market over time, geographical distribution, vehicle types, and the popularity of manufacturers and models, providing valuable insights into the EV industry's current state and future potential.

## Project Structure

- *Data Cleaning*: Handling missing values and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- *EV Adoption Over Time*: Analyzing the growth trend of EV registrations by model year.
- *Geographical Distribution*: Investigating the distribution of EV registrations across different counties and cities.
- *EV Types Analysis*: Exploring the breakdown of registered vehicles by electric vehicle type.
- *Manufacturer and Model Popularity*: Identifying the most popular EV manufacturers and models.
- *Electric Range Analysis*: Examining the distribution of electric vehicle ranges.
- *Trends in EV Models*: Analyzing trends in specific EV models over time.

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis is based on the electric vehicle population in the United States. It includes various attributes such as vehicle identification numbers (VIN), county and city of registration, model year, make, model, electric vehicle type, electric range, and more.

## Analysis and Results

### 1. EV Adoption Over Time

The analysis begins with a look at the adoption of electric vehicles over time. The EV Adoption Over Time chart below shows the number of EVs registered by model year.

*Key Findings:*
- *Tesla Model 3's Surge*: The Tesla Model 3 shows a significant surge in popularity, becoming one of the most registered EVs in recent years.
- *Other Models*: Other models, while popular, show more modest growth compared to the Tesla Model 3, indicating Tesla's strong market position.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of the electric vehicle market in the United States. The upward trend in EV adoption, the concentration of registrations in specific regions, the dominance of BEVs, the availability of EVs with varying ranges, and the popularity of manufacturers like Tesla underscore the rapid growth and evolving dynamics of the EV market. These insights can inform strategic decisions for businesses looking to enter or expand in the electric vehicle sector.

## Future Work

Further analysis could explore:
- *Longitudinal Studies*: Tracking EV adoption trends over a longer period.
- *Global Comparison*: Comparing the U.S. market with other regions.
- *Consumer Demographics*: Understanding the demographics driving EV adoption.
- *Policy Impact*: Analyzing the impact of government policies on EV adoption and market growth.
